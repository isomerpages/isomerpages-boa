As part of BOAâ€™s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Wo Mei Lan of Liu & Wo Architects Pte Ltd. Mei Lan co-founded Liu & Wo Architects Pte Ltd in 1984. This over 30 years medium sized firm does quality work both locally and overseas and has won several awards. She is the much respected driving force behind the successful growth and perseverance of the company.

Her professional career did not limit itself to office related duties only. Mei Lan has always been actively involved in serving the wide architectural and heritage community. She currently serves on the Board of Architects and the Preservation of Sites and Monuments Advisory Board, National Heritage Board.

She will share the winning competition proposal for Jurong Lake Gardens Central and East which blends the tropical setting of the existing architectural heritage of the Chinese and Japanese Gardens with ecological initiatives. New buildings incorporated have used innovative technologies and construction methods.
