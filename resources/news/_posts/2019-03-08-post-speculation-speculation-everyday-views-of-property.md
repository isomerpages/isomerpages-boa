**Abstract**

The concept of "speculation speculation' describes how city dewellers regularly and pervasively speculate about the activities of real estate speculators. Building from serveral cases in urban Vietnam, this paper argues that speculation speculation produces two contradictory effects.

On the one hand, it offers a continuous and ongoing critique of real estate speculation. On the other hand, the speculative nature of these critiques inadvertently normalizes the practuse of real estate speculation (which itself becomes understood as something continous and ongoing).
