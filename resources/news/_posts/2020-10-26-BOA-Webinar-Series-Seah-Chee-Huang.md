As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA is launching a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Seah Chee Huang of DP Architects Pte Ltd. He is a firm believer in purpose- driven architecture, synergising economic, environmental and social dynamics, to impact positive change and bring delight to the everyday lives. He is also recognised as one of Singapore emerging architects in Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)’s latest edition of 20 under 45.

Registered architects who are interested to sign up for the webinar are required to complete the [online registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aEtBT1ZuKCxGKDDmI_0MT4EjIK3m-bzE1ksNX9yKKn4/edit)
