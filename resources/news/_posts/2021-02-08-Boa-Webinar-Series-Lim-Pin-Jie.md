As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Lim Pin Jie of A D Lab Pte Ltd. Pin Jie is the Associate Director of the architecture firm A D Lab Pte Ltd. Founded in 2000 as a small experimental outfit by Ar. Warren Liu Yaw Lin and Ms Darlene Smyth that focused on cutting-edge residential projects, the practice has since grown in size and recognition over the past two decades. A D Lab’s approach sees architecture as an extension of a place and a context, that addresses specific technological, geographical, programmatic, social and economic conditions as an inter-connected system. The polymorphic nature of each individual project is fully embraced to allow its complexity, uniqueness and the “now-ness” to emerge from the design process. In this session, Pin Jie and his colleague, Senior Associate Ar. Heng Tzeng Hoong, will talk about A D Lab’s recent projects and how the practice is coping with the challenges in these uncertain times.
