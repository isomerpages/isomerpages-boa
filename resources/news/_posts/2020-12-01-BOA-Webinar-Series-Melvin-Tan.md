As part of BOAâ€™s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA is launching a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Melvin Tan of LAUD Architects Pte Ltd.
