### **BOA Circular: Waiver of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Requirements for the year 2020**

The Board of Architects is aware of how the COVID-19 (Coronavirus 2019) has impacted adversely the livelihoods and wellbeing of our registered architects. 

We understand that a number of CPD seminars have also been postponed in view of the safe distancing measures implemented by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to stem the spread of COVID-19 and for the safety and health of the participants, tutors, staff, etc. 

As part of our initiative to help the fraternity tide over the impact of the COVID-19, the Board, with unanimous support from all Board Members, would like to announce a one-off special waiver of the continuing professional development (CPD) requirements for the year 2020. From now to 31 Dec 2020, no CPD points will be awarded for any courses because of this exemption. The CPD points requirements will be resumed with effect from 1 Jan 2021 onwards. Architects can continue to attend courses to upgrade themselves, gain additional knowledge and get ready once the COVID-19 situation is fully contained.

With this special waiver of CPD points for 2020, you will still be able to renew your Practising Certificate for 2021. You need not gain any CPD points during this special exemption period as we will not grant any CPD points for all courses until 1 Jan 2021.

We are also actively working with the Singapore Institute of Architects and the other agencies to explore ways to help our architect with their professional development during this period and will update our registered architects in the coming weeks. SIA and other agencies will be able to roll out and test some online courses during this period and all architects are free to choose whatever courses that would be beneficial for them. There will not be any pressure on CPD points as no CPD points will be allocated from now to end Dec 2020.


Yours sincerely

**AR. NG LYE HOCK, LARRY**

**REGISTRAR**
