The President*s Design Award invites you to nominate an architect/project or make a submission directly by **30 August 2024, 12pm**.

_More than just beautiful architecture, well-designed buildings and spaces can offer real urban solutions, strengthen our communities, and uplift our souls._ 

The President*s Design Award recognises outstanding designs from all disciplines, from architecture to landscape, fashion and product design. It has honoured 45 Designs of the Year (Architecture) and 17 Designers of the Year (Architecture) in the last 18 years. These recognised projects and architects have contributed to Singapore’s economic transformation, enhanced the quality of our lives, advanced the Singapore brand, enriched local cultures and communities, and raised the bar on innovative designs. Beyond just an award, you will get to be part of the community of design advocates nurturing talents and driving Singapore’s architectural design excellence.
