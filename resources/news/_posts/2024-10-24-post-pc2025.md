### **Application for Practising Certificate 2025**

To all Registered Architects <br/>

(1) We would like to remind all registered architects that your Practising Certificate will expire on **31st December 2024** if you are holding one for the current year. The renewal process is essential to ensure that all practicing architects are in compliance with the Architects Act. Clause 18(1) of the Architects Act states that _“where a registered architect desires to engage in the practice of architecture in Singapore after 31 December of any year, he or she must, not later than 1 December of that year and in such form and manner as may be prescribed, apply for a practising certificate authorising him or her to engage in the practice of architecture in the succeeding year.”_  <br/>

(2) Please submit your application via this [online application form](https://go.gov.sg/boa-application-for-pc-2025). <br/> 

(3) Payment for the application can be made via **PayNow** or **bank transfer**.  You may refer to the instructions on the [Board’s website]( https://www.boa.gov.sg/files/Instructions_PayNow_Internet_Banking.pdf). You are required to upload the proof of payment onto the online application form. <br/>

(4) Additionally, please ensure that your application form is submitted to the Board and that you have the requisite CPD points by **1st December 2024** to avoid a late payment fee of $50/-. <br/>

(5) For any further inquiries, please contact us at BOA_Enquiry@boa.gov.sg. <br/>

Thank you for your attention. <br/>
 
Regards, <br/>
Tracey Hwang <br/>
Registrar <br/>
Board of Architects
