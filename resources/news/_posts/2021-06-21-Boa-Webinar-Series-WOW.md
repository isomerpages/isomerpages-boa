As part of BOAâ€™s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The architects we are featuring next in our dialogue series are Ar. Maria Warner Wong and Ar. Wong Chiu Man of WOW Architects. Maria and Chiu Man lead the international multidisciplinary consultancy firm WOW Architects | Warner Wong Design providing design expertise in architecture, interior and landscape design.  Their Mission is to create spaces of extraordinary sensory experience rooted in culture memory and place.

In the years since the firms were established, they have received multiple international design awards including the Singapore Institute of Architects building of the year, Prix Versailles, LEAF Awards, SBID Awards, AHEAD Awards.

Each project is characterized by deep research and design exploration that shape the office design culture, with projects that are experientially engaging and visually expressive, built on appropriate sustainability principles, a love of nature, thoughtful detailing and sensory depth.

With maturity of thought and increasingly pressing ecological issues, their work presents programmatically innovative and climatically driven solutions that question and provoke.  Research into new technologies and processes inform the design and construction methodologies, and their commitment to impactful and measurable results continues.
