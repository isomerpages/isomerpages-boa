As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Ko Shiou Hee of K2LD Architects Pte Ltd. He is one of the founding principal directors of K2LD Architects since the firm was established in 2000. Together with Ar. David Lee, they started K2LD Melbourne in 2007. K2LD is now 20 years old and comprises a group of passionate and diverse individuals who together, pursue greater design outcomes for the built environment. In 2020, the submission by Kengo Kuma & Associates in collaboration with K2LD Architects was selected as the winner of the international architectural design competition for the Founders’ Memorial which attracted a strong response of 193 submissions from local and foreign firms.
