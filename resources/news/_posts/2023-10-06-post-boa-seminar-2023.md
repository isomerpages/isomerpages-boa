### **BOA PRESENTATION CEREMONY AND SEMINAR, 7 NOV 2023**

The Board of Architects (BOA) will be holding our annual Seminar in conjunction with the 2023 Certificate Presentation Ceremony on **7 Nov 2023 (Tue)** at **8:30am** at the **Grand Ballroom, One Farrer Hotel, 1 Farrer Park Station Road, Singapore 217562**. <br/>

The BOA Presentation Ceremony is an annual event where the architectural fraternity gather to witness the conferment of Registration Certificates to our newly registered architects, and to get updates on issues pertinent to the profession and the industry locally and internationally. The event attracts more than 500 architects and guests from the built environment sector each year. <br/>
 
In 2022, Singapore announced that it would raise its national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as part of its Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy. With the built environment and construction sector accounting for over 30% of the global carbon emissions, sustainable architecture has become a key consideration in how buildings are designed and constructed. We have invited Ar. Phua Hong Wei of WOHA Architects Pte Ltd and Mr Henry Woon of Atelier Ten (Asia) Pte Ltd to share their approach in sustainable design and their vision for the future of architecture practice. <br/>

We have also invited six architects from the Urban Redevelopment Authorityâ€™s '20 Under 45' series to join the two speakers for a panel discussion on Sustainable Design and Practice. The discussion will be moderated by Ar. Larry Ng, Senior Advisor of the Board. <br/>

As seats for the seminar are limited, we would like to encourage you to register for the Seminar before **27 Oct 2023**. All participants will be given **8 CPD points** for attendance. <br/>

Please refer to the [Circular]({{site.baseurl}}/forms/Circular_BOASeminar_2023.pdf) for more information on the registration fees and payment methods available. <br/>
