### **2021 Asia Pacific Architecture Festival**

**How new is now?**

Is there any such thing as a new idea? The cyclic nature of the world can make it difficult to distinguish innovation from iteration. In response to challenging times, architectural and design agency must be applied in groundbreaking ways. Join us at the 2021 festival as we simultaneously learn from the past and optimistically look forward to the next decade of design with a careful balance of vision and pragmatism.
 
The 2021 Asia Pacific Architecture Festival will deliver an exciting program of exhibitions, installations, symposia, lectures and workshops that promote and celebrate architecture’s pivotal role in the culture, sustainability and economy of the Asia Pacific region.
