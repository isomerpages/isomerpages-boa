![URA i Light 2024 Poster](/forms/iLight_2024_Open_Call.pdf)

Asiaâ€™s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 10th edition to showcase new and exciting light art installations at Marina Bay.

For this edition, we invite artists to explore various forms of Sustainability and Sustainable Living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making and the community.

The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2024, **Cyclical Nature**, calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from the colour green - associated with nature as well as sustainable concepts such as the circular economy and upcycling.

**Cyclical Nature** reimagines the endless potential of everyday objects that are disposed of and their impact on nature through redesign, restoration, and repurposing.
