### **BOA Webinar Series: Dialogue with Donovan Soon of FDAT Architects LLP, 09 Jun 2021**

![BOA Webinar Poster](/images/BOA_Webinar_090621.jpg)

Donovan Soon and Francis Goh are the founding partners of FDAT, an architecture and design-focused studio based in Singapore. Both practiced for a decade at WOHA.

FDAT believes that good design can improve lives, spark interest and conversation while adding economic value, and shape our socio-cultural landscape positively. A key aspect of our design involves humanising our built environment and improving our relationship to greenery and nature.

We are a studio peopled by talented architects, managers and designers that work together to shape and drive projects across various scales. We enjoy different perspectives, strive to do good work, and try to have fun doing it.

FDAT has won accolades including the SIA Design Award and the Asia Property Award for Best High-Rise Condo Architecture. Donovan is recognised as one of Singapore’s emerging architects by URA’s latest edition of 20 Under 45. Projects led by the partners while at WOHA have also won the prestigious President’s Design Award.
