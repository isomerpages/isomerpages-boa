### **BOA PRESENTATION CEREMONY AND SEMINAR, 15 NOV 2022**

After a 2-year hiatus, the Board of Architects (BOA) will holding our annual Seminar in conjunction with the 2022 Certificate Presentation Ceremony on **15 Nov 2022 (Tue)** at 8:30am at the **Grand Ballroom, Grand Corpthorne Waterfront Hotel, 392 Havelock Road, Singapore 169663**. <br/>  

We are privileged that Mr. Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, will be gracing the occasion as our Event Host. <br/>            

The BOA Presentation Ceremony and Seminar is an annual event where the architectural fraternity gather to witness the conferment of Registration Certificates to our newly registered architects, and to get updates on issues pertinent to the profession and the industry locally and internationally. <br/>   

We have invited two local architects who have gone beyond the practice of architecture and contributed to the community to speak at this yearâ€™s Seminar. Ar. Chan Soo Khian, founding principal of award-winning SCDA Architects Pte Ltd, spearheaded an initiative to distribute locally grown rice to the community in exchange for used plastic to encourage sustainability and this effort has won his resort, Soori Bali, The Leading Hotels of the World Change-Makers Award in 2021. Ar. Rudy Taslim, principal of Genesis Architect, is working in Ukraine with his wife to build new bomb-resistant emergency homes for citizens affected by the war and they have built 200 homes with local partners in the region since the war started in February. <br/>  

There will also be an interactive panel discussion, moderated by the Registrar of the Board, where we will invite architects in different career stages to share and discuss their experiences and the critical issues affecting architecture practice. <br/>  

As seats for the seminar are limited, we would like to encourage you to register for the Seminar before **7 Nov 2022**. All participants will be given **8 CPD points** for attendance. <br/>
