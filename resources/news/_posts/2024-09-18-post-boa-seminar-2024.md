### **BOA PRESENTATION CEREMONY AND SEMINAR 2024, 15 OCTOBER 2024** <br/>

**BLUEPRINT AND BEYOND: NAVIGATING THE FUTURE OF ARCHITECTURE IN A CHANGING WORLD** <br/>

_**Update: Registration for the seminar is now closed due to overwhelming response. Thank you for your support!**_

The Board of Architects (BOA) will be holding our annual Seminar in conjunction with the 2024 Certificate Presentation Ceremony on **15 Oct 2023 (Tue)** at **8:00am** at the **Grand Ballroom, One Farrer Hotel, 1 Farrer Park Station Road, Singapore 217562**. <br/>

The BOA Presentation Ceremony is an annual event where the architectural fraternity gather to witness the conferment of Registration Certificates to our newly registered architects, and to get updates on issues pertinent to the profession and the industry locally and internationally. The event attracts more than 500 architects and guests from the built environment sector each year. <br/>
 
Sustainability has become a top priority among decision-makers in our current global economic and business environment. With sustainability in mind, we explore the challenges and trends that lies ahead for the profession. We have invited Mr Christoper Law of Oval Partnership, Ar. Melvin Tan of the Singapore Institute of Architects and Ar. Yeo Siew Haip of Surbana Jurong Group to share their views on the future of architecture and the architectural profession. <br/>

As seats for the seminar are limited, we would like to encourage you to register for the Seminar before **4 Oct 2024**. All participants will be given **8 CPD points** for attendance. <br/>
