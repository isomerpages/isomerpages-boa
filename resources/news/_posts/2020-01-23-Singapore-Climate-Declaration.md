### **Singapore Architects and Structural Engineers join Construction Declares**

<p> Singapore, although somewhat protected by its equatorial location and its “City in a Garden” policies, has been experiencing the twin crises of climate breakdown and loss of biodiversity with increasing periods of drought and higher temperatures. The Climate Emergency is the most serious issue of our time, and buildings and construction play a major part - accounting for nearly 40% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions whilst also having a significant impact on our natural habitats.

<p> 新加坡，2020年元月  –  新加坡虽受靠近赤道的地理位置以及‘花园城市’政策的保护， 如今亦受到气候破坏和生态失调所带来的双重危机影响而发生持续干旱和高温。气候危机是目前最紧要的问题，而建筑行业在这方面扮演重要角色 – 造成将近40%与能源有关的二氧化碳排放，同时也对生态环境造成重大影响。
 
<p> Construction Declares is a global petition uniting all strands of construction and the built environment. It is both a public declaration of our planet’s environmental crises and a commitment to take positive action in response to climate breakdown and biodiversity collapse. Singapore is the first Asian country to join Construction Declares with both architects and structural engineers as founding signatories.

<p> <建筑宣告>是一项全球请愿书，将所有施工环节和建成环境融为一体。 这既是对我们星球环境危机的公开声明，也是对应对气候崩溃和生物多样性崩溃采取积极行动的承诺。 新加坡是第一个加入“建筑宣言”的亚洲国家，创建人为建筑师和结构工程师。

<p> Architects: CSYA, DP Architects, Forum Architects, Guz Architects, HASSELL, SCDA and WOHA.

<p> 建筑师：CSYA建筑师事务所，DP工程师，论坛建筑师，Guz建筑师，HASSELL，SCDA和WOHA
 
<p> Structural engineers: ARUP, DP Engineers, RSP, Web Structures and WSP.

<p> 结构工程师：Arup，DP工程师，RSP，Web Structures和WSP
 
<p> This Climate Declaration is a call to action for everyone working in construction and the built environment to meet the needs of our societies without breaching the earth’s ecological boundaries. This will demand a paradigm shift in our behaviour. If we are to reduce and eventually reverse the environmental damage we are causing, we will need to re-imagine our buildings, cities and infrastructures as indivisible components of a larger, constantly regenerating and self-sustaining system.

<p> 该<气候宣言>呼吁所有在建筑和建筑环境中工作的人们在不侵害地球自然·生态边界的情况下满足我们社会的需求。 这将要求我们的行为发生范式转变。 如果我们要减少并最终扭转我们对环境造成的破坏，我们将需要重新构想建筑物，城市和基础设施，将其作为一个更大，不断再生和自我维持的系统不可分割的组成部分。
