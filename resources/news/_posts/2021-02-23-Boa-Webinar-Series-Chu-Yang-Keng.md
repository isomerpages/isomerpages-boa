As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Chu Yang Keng of IX Architects Pte Ltd. Chu is the founder of IX Architects Pte Ltd which was established in 2004.  He has contributed actively to the fraternity in the SIA SMAP committee and he has been appointed as an examiner for the BOA PPE Examinations in previous years. Chu emphasizes on each individual’s professional development in his practice and he is also an Advisor to the NUS internship programme. 
  
As a Registered ASEAN Architect, Chu has been practicing regionally especially in Cambodia where he has built a wide and diverse portfolio over the last decade.  With a strong interest in nature centric designs, Chu aspires to create environmentally conscious designs that inspires and enhances the quality of life.
