As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA is launching a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Khairudin Saharom of Kite Studio Architecture. He was one of the 20 promising architects under the age of 45 who was featured in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s “20 Under 45” in 2018 and is currently a member of the Board.
