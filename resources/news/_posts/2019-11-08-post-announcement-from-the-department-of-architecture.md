### **Announcement from the Department of Architecture**

The Department of Architecture, NUS has introduced a structured 6-month Architecture Internship Programme (AIP) during the past two academic years. It has been on a voluntary basis and has met with euthusiasm from students and many had volunteered for it.

Commencing from academic year 2020-2021, the AIP will be compulsory for all students admitted to the M.Arch course and they have to undergo 6 months of architecture internership under the guidance of the AIP Committee from the Department of Architecture. The AIP (module AR4421) shall carry 8 modular credits.

The AIP is essential to complement architectural education - it is an attachment to a real-life working environment which will expose the students to a range of practice experiences which cannot be taught in the university. It is hoped that such exposure will add to the learning process and maturity of the student when he or she graduates from the M. Arch course in NUS.

The objective of the Architecture Internship Programme (AIP) is three-fold:

(a) to offer students opportunities for exposure to real-life situations during the period of internship

(b) to allow students time and opportunity to develop competence, understanding of the professional responsibilities and maturity in the design process

(c) to develop a critical awareness of the state of the architecture profession and its future

There will be two periods of internship - from June to end November and from December to end May of the same academic year with about 60-70 students doing AIP in each period. After consultation with the Board of Architects and the Singapore Institute of Architects, the monthly stipend is fixed at SGD1500. Funding up to SGD700 per month per student intern is available for SME's and firms can apply for funding from Global Ready Talent (GRT@enterprisesg@gov.sg) - kindly enquire directly with them.

Architect firms registered with the Board of Architects are highly encouraged to register heir interest with the NUS Talent COnnect portal indicating the number of interns they intend to employ for each semester. Should you have any difficulty registering, please contact Mr Jason Chong who will assist you. If you have further queries, please send an email to:
