TO GATHER: The Architecture of Relationships
The Singapore Pavilion at the 17th International Architecture Exhibition, La Biennale di Venezia

OPEN CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

---

TO GATHER, the Singapore pavilion’s response to the call of the 17th International Architectural Biennale in Venice, welcomes nominations and proposals from architects and architectural designers working in collaboration with artists, craftspeople, journalists, writers and creatives.

---
The International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia was established in 1980, and it shines a spotlight on the creative and critical responses of architects and creatives to various themes and concerns. For the 2020 edition, national pavilions have been called to respond to a simple question: how will we live together?

Singapore’s urban landscape is constantly evolving in relation to the various needs of the fast-developing city-state. In Singapore, spaces are planned, allocated, demarcated, and built with, amongst many other things, functionality, sustainability, and long-term goals in mind. 

In recent years, the advent of technology and social media have simultaneously mobilised actions and supported causes, as well as highlighted issues of polarised societies and social bubbles. 

There has never been a more pressing need for the dialogue of alternative modes of thinking, organising, and living to occur.

Various ground-up collectives and initiatives have emerged in response to these challenges, and these grassroot galvanisations have reinvigorated our socio-cultural landscape through efforts such as community art and design projects, social enterprise, urban farming and pop-up showcases. They propose creative solutions for organising ourselves in ways that are both productive and transformative. More importantly, their efforts offer a tantalising vision of what is possible when we situate ourselves within networks of connectedness and sharing, and to serve as an inspiration to continually reinvent and adapt ourselves amidst our limitations of density and resources.

Besides built projects, we encourage submissions emphasising speculative or unbuilt works that exemplify architectural imagination on how we will live together contemporaneously and in the future. With TO GATHER, we underscore that no entity exists by itself since everyone of us, by necessity, coexist as part of a complex social and ecological assemblage, mutually influencing, supporting and reinforcing one another. We are particularly interested in multi-scalar modes of gathering manifested spatially and temporally; projects that explore patterns of sympoiesis and strategies of connectedness that architects and architectural designers, working with others, have imagined, convened, cared for or built.

This exhibition marks Singapore’s seventh appearance at the International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia, since 2004. By thinking about architecture relationally and connected to the broader built and natural environment, the exhibition space will be a convivial gathering of ideas, scholarship, conversations and projects.

TO GATHER holds different meanings, opportunities and challenges in our time. Participants and nominators are asked to frame their submissions for one of the following platforms:

⦁	Vernacular as a space of everyday associations and interactions for different constituencies and at various durations.

⦁	Civic critically examines the historical formation of the Singapore story, and highlights Singapore's impact on a regional level and beyond

⦁	Uncharted calls for imaginative forays into speculative futures, inviting projects that are experimental in nature and hypothesises the production of new realities.

The selected projects from this Open Call will fall under one of the three above curatorial themes.

---

These are six questions the curatorial team hopes to address through the three platforms.

⦁	How do urban and built spaces function as convenors or conduits for gathering, interaction and dialogue between diverse groups of people?

⦁	How are meaningful connections and relationships between the digital realm and physical space, between humans and other species, formed?

⦁	How have emerging communities come together to address questions of equity, inclusion and spatial identity?

⦁	How can we imagine public housing and/or urban infrastructure that embraces inclusivity? 

⦁	How can we capture the essence of the Singapore story in coming together to overcome the limitations of density and resources by continuously innovating towards liveability and sustainability?

⦁	How would spaces for living together look like fifty years from now?

In order to submit, please use this application form (https://forms.gle/NtTXKatFoDFbzR1E9). Participants are asked to submit a 300 word abstract that outlines their project and up to three supporting images.

For further enquiries, please contact Joella Kiu at joellakiu@nus.edu.sg.

THE SINGAPORE PAVILION
Jointly commissioned by Urban Redevelopment Authority and the DesignSingapore Council, the Singapore Pavilion at the 17th Venice Biennale International Architecture Exhibition (VBIAE) will be curated by the National University of Singapore (NUS). The members of the curatorial team are Dr Simone Chung, Dr Puay-peng Ho, Ar. Thomas Kong and Tomohisa Miyauchi, and assisted by Joella Qingyi Kiu
The Singapore Pavilion is a 250 sqm space in a complex of buildings called the Sale d’Armi, which is centrally located and easily accessible within the Arsenale, a key site in Venice. The Sale d’Armi complex is a cluster of four 16th century barracks built with brick and stone, each with a wooden roof. It lies opposite the intersection between the long Corderie and Artiglierie buildings, where the main central square of the Arsenale is situated.
