### **BOA PRESENTATION CEREMONY AND SEMINAR 2025, 17 OCTOBER 2025** <br/>

**SUSTAINING DESIGN, SUSTAINING PRACTICE** <br/>

The Board of Architects warmly invites members of the architectural fraternity to the BOA Presentation Ceremony and Seminar 2025, a key annual gathering that celebrates the profession while engaging with the pressing questions that shape architectural practice today. <br/>

This year’s seminar theme, “_Sustaining Design, Sustaining Practice_”, calls on architects to reflect on how we can uphold design excellence while sustaining our practice amidst the shifting landscapes of technology, climate, culture, and society. <br/>

At the inaugural Building Singapore Festival, Ms Indranee Rajah, Second Minister for National Development and Co-Chair of the Taskforce, announced the Taskforce for Architectural and Engineering Consultants’ Report. The report outlines how stakeholders—from Built Environment (BE) consultants to service buyers—can collectively strengthen the talent pipeline and business sustainability of the BE consultancy sector. <br/>

To bring these insights to the profession, we have invited two members of the Taskforce, Mr Kelvin Wong, Chief Executive Officer of the Building and Construction Authority, and Ar. Melvin Tan, Immediate Past President of the Singapore Institute of Architects, to share the key recommendations of the report with the fraternity. <br/>

In addition, our keynote speaker, Dr Hossein Rezai, Founding Director of Web Structures and Global Design Director of Ramboll, will examine how design and foresight can equip architects to navigate complexity and stay relevant in a rapidly evolving world. He will explore the synergies between sustainability, technology, regeneration, and systemic thinking—while asking critical questions about the future roles of architects and allied professionals as artificial intelligence continues to reshape practice. <br/>

His keynote, “_Differentiating in a Noisy World_,” challenges us as architects to distinguish between the genuine megatrends shaping the built environment and the background noise that distracts from meaningful innovation—guiding us towards clarity, resilience, and purpose in practice. <br/>

Don’t miss this inspiring session, which brings together voices shaping the future of the profession—spanning policy, regulation, practice, and design innovation. <br/>
