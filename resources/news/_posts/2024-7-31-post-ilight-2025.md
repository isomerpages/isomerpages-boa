Asia’s leading sustainable light festival will return for its 11th edition next year to showcase exciting light art installations at Marina Bay and its neighbouring precincts. <br/>

Every edition, we invite artists to explore various forms of sustainability and sustainable living - of environment, economy and culture - and examine how light art can create conversations about our lifestyles, decision making and the community. <br/>

The curatorial theme of i Light Singapore 2025, **_To Gather_**, calls for innovative light art installations that draw inspiration from the colour red in moving the human collective. As the lifeblood of our collective existence, red is the common thread that binds us all together – a call to embrace unity in diversity. <br/>

**_To Gather_** strives to spark conversations, foster vibrant communities and inspire collective action so as to effect positive change for a more sustainable future.
