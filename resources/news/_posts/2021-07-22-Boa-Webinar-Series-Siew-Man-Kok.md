As part of BOAâ€™s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Siew Man Kok of MKPL Architects. Man Kok is one of the founding partners of MKPL Architects. Together with Cheng Pai Ling, they set up MKPL Architects in 1995.

The firm saw interpreting the local vernacular with technology in a contemporary context, in pursuit of an Architecture that will speak of its locale, climate & culture.  The firm has won numerous local and international awards and is continuing to diversify, tackling seminal contemporary concerns such as public housing planning and design, sustainable living environments, innovative educational spaces, adaptive reuse of the heritage buildings such as the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station and preservation and rejuvenation of the Rail Corridor. 

Man Kok was honored the President's Design Award for two consecutive years: in 2014 Kent Vale Faculty Housing received the Design of the Year, and in 2015 he received the prestigious Designer of the Year accolade for his outstanding contribution to design and culture in Singapore.
