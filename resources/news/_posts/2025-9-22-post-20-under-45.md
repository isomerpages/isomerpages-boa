Launched in 2004, the ‘20 Under 45’ Architects Programme by URA celebrates young and emerging registered architects in Singapore. Across its past three editions, 60 architects have been recognised, many of whom have gone on to shape impactful works locally and globally.

The fourth edition honours 23 architects, reflecting both the resilience of the community post-pandemic and the exceptional calibre of this year’s recipients.
