BOA 116.2 (Circular)

23 Mar 2024

To All Registered Architects

### **Collaboration with Foreign Architects**

This circular is to remind BOA Registered Architects that all Foreign Architects collaborating with Registered Architects for projects in Singapore are required to register the collaboration with the Board. This is in accordance with Rule 2 (4) and Rule 2 (7) of the Architects Rules as amended in 2017. <br/>

The Registered Architect should advise the Foreign Architect to submit an application for collaboration to the Board when a Foreign Architect is involved in the same building project, irrespective of any formal collaboration or arrangement. <br/>

The Board has noted that some of these formal or informal collaborations since 2017, whether completed or ongoing, are not registered with the Board. The Board will allow a one-time registration of all projects retrospectively to regularize the collaborations. <br/>

The applications are to be submitted to the Board within three months from the date of this Circular. The Board will have the right to reject applications submitted after the deadline. <br/>

Please take note that failure by Foreign Architects to collaborate with a BOA Registered Architect on building projects in Singapore and to register their collaboration with the Board will have the following implications: <br/>

a.	The Board may not approve future applications for collaboration by the Foreign Architect (or other architects from their practice). <br/>

b.	The Foreign Architect (and/or their practice) will be deemed to have provided illegal architectural services in Singapore and thereby have contravened section 10 of the Architects Act. <br/>

c.	By not reminding the Foreign Architect (and/or their practice) to register their collaboration, the BOA Registered Architect will be deemed to be abetting illegal architectural services in Singapore - including any involvement of a Foreign Architect (and/or their practice) in the same building project in Singapore, irrespective of any formal collaboration agreement or arrangement. <br/>

d.	The Board is empowered under section 10 of the Architects Act to take action against the BOA Registered Architect. <br/> 

The above is for your information and compliance.
