IBEW has been hugely successful since its inception in 2019, drawing more than 20,000 attendees from over 100 countries. This year’s IBEW, which will be held in-person from 5 to 9 September 2022, embraces the theme **“Accelerating Transformation, Growing Together”**. The event emphasises the importance of stepping up our transformation and grow stronger collaboratively, to capture the global opportunities emerging from the post-pandemic economies. <br/>  

IBEW 2022 is back this year as a **physical event**. Besides our main conference and trade show  - BEX Asia, we have lined up other exciting activities such as site tours to local exemplary projects with notable efforts in environmental sustainability and DfMA adoption as well as business networking events. <br/>

Featuring a stellar line up of over 70 industry leaders and domain experts, IBEW Conference will tap on their expertise and views on the latest technologies and trends that cover three core pillars - **Sustainability & Green Economy, Technology & Innovation and Leadership & Future Growth**.<br/>
