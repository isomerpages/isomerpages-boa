### **BOA Webinar Series: Dialogue with Ong Ker-Shing of Lekker Architects, 24 May 2021**

![BOA Webinar Poster](/images/BOA_Webinar_240521.jpg)

As part of BOA’s on-going effort to engage our registered architects during the COVID-19 pandemic, BOA has launched a series of complimentary webinars where we feature our local architects and speak to them about their experiences in the face of the challenges brought about by COVID-19. 

The next architect we are featuring in our dialogue series is Ar. Ong Ker-Shing of Lekker Architects. Ker-Shing is Founder/ Director of Lekker Architects and an Associate Professor at NUS Department of Architecture where she is currently the Programme Director of the BA Architecture programme.

Lekker is a small group of designers and architects who are fascinated by the power of space to engage us, to create formative moments, and to provide a stage for public life. Lekker’s interest lies in projects with big ambitions from buildings that promote inclusion, neighbourhoods that encourage walking and socializing, to dreamlike retail experiences that are exciting and transformative. Together with critical questioning, careful observation, and having fun with design, Lekker aims to bring new perspectives into projects. 

Ker-Shing was selected as one of URA’s 20 under 45 (Third Edition), and with Lekker, won a PDA for Design of the Year (2015). 

Registered architects who are interested to sign up for the webinar are required to complete the [online registration form](https://forms.gle/yxJ5G9hMMuoYWTT59)
