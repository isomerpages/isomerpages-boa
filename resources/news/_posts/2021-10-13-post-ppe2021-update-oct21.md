### **Update on the Professional Practice Examination (PPE) 2021**

The Board would like to update the PPE candidates who have signed up for the Professional Practice Examination 2021 on the timeline for the examination. 

As you may be aware, last year’s written examination was postponed to March 2021 and the oral examination was correspondingly postponed to June 2021 to comply with the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Despite the delays, we are happy to announce that the passing rate of the candidates is consistent with the past few years. 

To bring candidates up to date with this year’s examination, we would like to report that the examination panel has completed the review of the case studies submitted for PPE 2021 and has conducted follow up sessions for candidates that do not meet requirements in September 2021 via Zoom. 

We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation to determine the appropriate timing to proceed with the written examination. In view of the enhanced SMMs announced to slow down the transmissions and to safeguard the health and interests of our candidates, we would like to announce that the written examinations, which is traditionally held in November, will be postponed to the **first quarter of 2022**. 

We will continue to monitor the situation over the next two to three months before we schedule the date for the written examination. Addressing the feedback from candidates, we would like to reassure you that candidates will be given advance notice to allow you time to make the necessary arrangements for the examinations. 

Please email us at BOA_Enquiry@boa.gov.sg if you have any further enquiries regarding the examination.
