### *Recognition of Strategic Leadership and Business-related Courses under the CPD Framework**

The Board of Architects (BOA) will, with effect from this year, allow the recognition of selected strategic leadership and business-related courses under the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) framework. This is intended to support the professional development of architects by strengthening leadership capabilities, management skills and business acumen, which are increasingly relevant in the practice environment. <br/>

Registered architects who wish to have such courses considered for CPD points are required to submit the course details individually to the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) for assessment. Course providers may also submit the applications to SIA for their courses to be considered for CPD point recognition. Submissions should be made to SIA via cpd@sia.org.sg. <br/> 

All submissions should include the following information:
-	Course title and provider
-	Course outline and learning objectives
-	Duration and mode of delivery
-	Relevance to professional practice, leadership or business competencies
-	Any supporting materials (eg, programme, slides or reading list) <br/>

The submissions will be subject to evaluation by the Joint Approving Panel (BOA and SIA). In assessing such courses, the Panel may consider the relevance, depth and learning outcomes of the course, and its applicability to the profession and practice responsibilities of architects. The award of CPD points is not automatic and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. <br/>

Architects are advised to obtain confirmation of CPD point recognition prior to relying on such courses to meet the practicing certification application requirements.<br/>

BOA will continue to review the CPD framework to ensure its relevance to the professional and practice needs of the architectural sector.<br/>
