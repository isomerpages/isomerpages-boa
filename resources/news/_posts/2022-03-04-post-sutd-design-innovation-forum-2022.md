### **SUTD Design Innovation Forum in partnership with The Straits Times**

**About the Webinar**

SUTD’s mission of "A Better World by Design" forms the foundation of its Sustainability Plan to create a "More Sustainable and Happier World by Design". SUTD places wellbeing at the core of its Sustainability plan, supporting our community to build sustainable lifestyles that grow individual happiness by leveraging technology and design thinking.

Human centricity is key to sustainability by design. The quest for a net zero world has seen attempts to solve climate change challenges swing in extremity towards technology. Such approach results in unbalanced world and fails to address the “why” part of sustainability efforts. There is a need to restore the true purpose of sustainability - to achieve holistic health and wellness for human societies. In doing so, they form a synergy of self and community known as "sustainable happiness".

In a world where design and technology play vital roles in transforming our everyday, join us and our distinguished speakers at the second edition of SUTD's Design Innovation Forum to explore how we can drive innovation and create a more sustainable and happier world by design.
