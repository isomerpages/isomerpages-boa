### **Restrictions on Architecture-Related Job Titles**

**Restrictions on the use of the word “Architect”**

(1) Under section 10(3)(a) of the Architects Act, “a person must not use verbally or otherwise the word 'architect' or any of its derivatives in connection with the person’s business designation, or any other words, name or designation that will lead to the belief that the person is an architect unless the person is a registered architect who has in force a practising certificate”.

(2) Such derivatives of the word “architect” that the BOA holds will lead to the belief that the person is an architect include, without limitation:
- Registered Architect
- Building Architect
- Project Architect
- Site Architect or Resident Architect
- Graduate Architect
- Assistant Architect
- Associate Architect
- Junior Architect
- Architect of Record
- Architectural Qualified Person or Qualified Person (Architecture)
- Architectural Director
- Architectural Partner
- Architectural Lead
- Architectural Key Person

(3) However, under section 15(2A) & (2B) of the Architects Act, a person authorised to practise architecture in a foreign jurisdiction and who is duly registered by the BOA may refer to themselves as:
- Foreign Architect

**Restrictions on Architecture-Related Job Titles**

(4) Notwithstanding any educational qualifications using terms such as “architectural”, “architecture”, etc, no person may use job titles such as:
- Architectural Graduate
- Architectural Associate 
- Architectural Designer or Designer (Architecture)
- Architectural Assistant
- Architectural Coordinator <br/>
unless <br/> 
(a) the person’s job is under a contract of service or contract for service to an ‘architectural practice’ (as defined in section 2 of the Architects Act or a registered Foreign Architect pursuant to sub-sections 15(2A) & (2B) of the Architects Act), and <br/>
(b) the person has appropriate educational qualifications to support such a title*.

These titles are of a nature that will lead to the wrongful belief or misunderstanding that the person’s or employer’s business activities include the offer and supply of architectural services.

*Note: the job titles: <br/>
•	Architectural Graduate <br/>
•	Architectural Associate <br/>
are reserved exclusively for individuals holding architectural qualifications that are recognised by the BOA as entitling the individual to registration as an architect pursuant to sub-section 15(1) of the Architects Act.

(5) For situations such as building contractors handling and coordinating drawings, specifications and information of an architectural nature for construction-management purposes, the following job title may be used:
- Architectural Coordinator

(6) These directives are premised on the Architects Act as follows: <br/>
(a) Under sub-section 10(3)(b) of the Architects Act, no individual or business may advertise or hold or conduct themself in any way or by any means as a person who is authorised to supply architectural services in Singapore, unless the person is a registered architect who has in force a practising certificate or a licensed architectural practice. <br/>
(b) Under section 2 of the Architects Act, ‘architectural services’ includes selling or supplying for gain or reward any architectural plan or the like – which includes architectural design drawings and electronic models - for use in the construction, enlargement or alteration of any building in Singapore. <br/>
(c) Correspondingly, under section 10(1) of the Architects Act, a person must not draw or prepare any architectural plan, specification or other document intended to govern the construction, enlargement or alteration of any building in Singapore unless the person (a) is a registered architect who has in force a practising certificate; or (b) is doing so under the direction or supervision of a person mentioned in paragraph; or, under section 15(2A) & (2B) of the Architects Act, is a BOA-registered Foreign Architect.
