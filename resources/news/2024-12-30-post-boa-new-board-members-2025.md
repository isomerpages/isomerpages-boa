### **Members of the Board of Architects 2025 - 2027**

To All Architects<br/>

The Board of Architects (BOA) would like to thank all architects for your participation and support during the recent 2024 Board Election. For the first time, the election was conducted digitally, aligning with the government’s broader digital transformation initiatives to enhance efficiency and accessibility. <br/> 

The digital process was also introduced to provide greater convenience, particularly for architects based overseas or travelling during the election period, ensuring inclusive participation for all registered architects. <br/>

While the digital election process was a step forward and well received by the majority of the architects for its accessibility and efficiency, we recognise that some architects faced challenges in casting their votes. To prevent emails from BOA being filtered into spam or junk folders or not being received in future, we recommend: <br/>
•	Whitelisting BOA’s (@boa.gov.sg) and Postman’s (@mail.postman.gov.sg) email domain to ensure important communications are delivered to your inbox. <br/>
•	Adding BOA’s email address BOA_enquiry@boa.gov.sg into your safe sender list. <br/>
•	Regularly checking your spam or junk folders, particularly during critical periods. <br/>
•	Updating your contact information with BOA to maintain accurate records. <br/>

As this was the inaugural digital election, BOA has decided to grant a one-time waiver of the $300 penalty for all the architect who did not submit the election form. For those who have already paid the penalty, a refund will be given. We kindly request your patience as we process this refund. <br/>

We thank you for your commitment to the architectural profession and your support as we embrace digital transformation to better serve our fraternity. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at BOA_enquiry@boa.gov.sg. <br/>
